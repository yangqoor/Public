MDSPTK (Matlab Digital Signal Processing ToolKit). 

Description:
	The MDSPTK consists from three classes, 
	what can be used at everyday DSP practice.

Classes:
@ssource - signal source. Provide ability to generate different waveforms, 
	what can be used at MATLAB dsp algorithms implementation.

@fanalyzer - means filter analyzer. 
	Provides ability to calculate and plot different analyzes used in dsp. 
	Homemade analog of MATLAB fvtool.

@fsaver - filters saver. Provide ability to save filter data at comma-separated representation, 
	that can be used with C/C++ source. 
	Have fsaver.h header, where C-functions for comma-separated data including provided.

How to run:
	Open Matlab in src folder (it must be work folder for Matlab).
	Run copy_demo_files.sh.
	Open any *TB.m script in Matlab and run it.
