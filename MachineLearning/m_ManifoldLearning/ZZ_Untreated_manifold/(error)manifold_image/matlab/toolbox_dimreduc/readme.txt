toolbox_dimreduc - a toolbox for dimension reduction methods

This toolbox is an educational and recreative toolbox around recent ideas in the field of dimension reduction.

This toolbox contains a set of helpers and test scripts to play with the following algorithms :
* PCA : classical Principal Componnent Analysis (linear projection).
* Isomap <http://isomap.stanford.edu/>

This toolbox contains the sources provided by the authors of these articles, slightly modified to get a cleaner interface. These codes are under the copyright of the corresponding authors.

This toolbox contains tests files to see the application of these algorithm in three settings :
* Simple 3D clouds.
* 3D mesh with given connectivity.
* Images data sets.

The images data sets are borrowed from : 
* Roweis datas <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~roweis/data.html>
* MNIST handwritten digits database <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>
They are *NOT* included in the distribution of the toolbox available on Matlab central.
The file data.zip should be retrieved from here
<http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~peyre/cours/data.zip>
and unzipped in the same directory as the toolbox.

Installation: you have to put the directory toolbox/ into you matlab path.
