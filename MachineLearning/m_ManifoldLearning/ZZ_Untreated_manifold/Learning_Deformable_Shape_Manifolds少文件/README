The 'full' version loads images and associated landmark coordinates from individual files then does parameter tuning, eye detection, face rotation, and shape detection as described in the above paper.  It has many pieces so it may not be easy for users to modify.  See README within the .zip file for examples and documentation.  This package makes use of several additional toolboxes.  Please see contained directories for additional credit and license information.
The 'basic' version does the simple shape detection, where you can input the images and landmarks which are pre-stored in matrices and detect a full shape.  It is meant to be modular and simple for those who want to understand the algorithm and would like to modify it.  It is recommended that you do your own parameter tuning. See README within the .zip file for examples and documentation.
