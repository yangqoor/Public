# Industrial Machinery Anomaly Detection 

[![View <Industrial Machinery Anomaly Detection using an Autoencoder> on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/90752-industrial-machinery-anomaly-detection-using-an-autoencoder)

This example applies various anomaly detection approaches to operating data from an industrial machine. Specifically it covers: 
- Extracting relevant features from industrial vibration timeseries data using the Diagnostic Feature Designer app
- Anomaly detection using several statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques, including: 
    - LSTM-based autoencoders
    - One-class SVM
    - Isolation forest
    - Robust covariance and Mahalanobis distance

## Setup 
This demo is implemented as a MATLAB® project and will require you to open the project to run it. The project will manage all paths and shortcuts you need. 

To Run:
1. Open the MATLAB Project `AnomalyDetection.prj`
2. Open Parts 1-3 on the Project Shortcuts tab
