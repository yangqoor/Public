# Deep Learning (DL)  
`Deep learning` is a subset of machine learning and can been used for `unsupervised` nor `supervised` problems. in `Artificial Intelligence` that has networks capable of learning `unsupervised` nor `supervised` from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as `deep neural learning` or `deep neural network`. `Deep Learning` has evolved hand-in-hand with the digital era, which has brought about an explosion of data in all forms and from every region of the world. This data, known simply as big data, is drawn from sources like social media, internet search engines, e-commerce platforms, and online cinemas, among others. This enormous amount of data is readily accessible and can be shared through fintech applications like cloud computing. However, the data, which normally is unstructured, is so vast that it could take decades for humans to comprehend it and extract relevant information. Companies realize the incredible potential that can result from unraveling this wealth of information and are increasingly adapting to `AI` systems for automated support.
