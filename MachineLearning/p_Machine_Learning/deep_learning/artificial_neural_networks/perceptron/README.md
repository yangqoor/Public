# Perceptron(P)  
The `Perceptron` is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers.  
Binary classifiers decide whether an input, usually represented by a series of vectors, belongs to a specific class.  
In short, a perceptron has 1 filter that has one character property.

When people say `Neuron`/`Unit`/`Node` when they mean the structure of a `Perceptron`.
