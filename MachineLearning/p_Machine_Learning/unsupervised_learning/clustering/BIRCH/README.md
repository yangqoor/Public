# BIRCH
[`BIRCH`](https://www.pallavikulkarni.in/incremental-clustering-with-birch-algorithm/) (`Balanced Iterative Reducing` and `Clustering` using `Hierarchies`) is used to perform hierarchical clustering over particularly large data-sets.  
With modifications it can also be used to accelerate `k-means` clustering and `Gaussian mixture` modeling with the expectationâ€“maximization algorithm.  
An advantage of `BIRCH` is its ability to incrementally and dynamically cluster incoming, multi-dimensional metric data points in an attempt to produce the best quality clustering for a given set of resources (memory and time constraints).  
In most cases, `BIRCH` only requires a single scan of the database And this can lead to fast working cluster
