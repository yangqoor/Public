# Deep Feed Forward(FF)
`Deep Feed Forward`, `MultiLayer Perceptron` and `Multilayer Feed Forward`, is a structure that is using more perceptrons.  
Using 1 single perceptron(neuron) is quitly useless as it has only 1 linear line, where there are more perceptrons(neurons) you will have more lines that will makes it a non-linearity separation.

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN).  
An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer.  
Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function.
