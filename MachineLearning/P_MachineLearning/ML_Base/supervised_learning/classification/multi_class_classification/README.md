# Multi-Class Classification
`Multi-class classification` refers to those classification tasks that have more than two class labels.

Unlike binary classification, `multi-class classification` does not have the notion of normal and abnormal outcomes. Instead, examples are classified as belonging to one among a range of known classes.

The number of class labels may be very large on some problems. For example, a model may predict a photo as belonging to one among thousands or tens of thousands of faces in a face recognition system.

Problems that involve predicting a sequence of words, such as text translation models, may also be considered a special type of `multi-class classification`. Each word in the sequence of words to be predicted involves a `multi-class classification` where the size of the vocabulary defines the number of possible classes that may be predicted and could be tens or hundreds of thousands of words in size.
