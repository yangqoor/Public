# Imbalanced Classification
`Imbalanced classification` refers to classification tasks where the number of examples in each class is unequally distributed.

Typically, imbalanced classification tasks are binary classification tasks where the majority of examples in the training dataset belong to the normal class and a minority of examples belong to the abnormal class.

Most difficult tasks still for algorithms to get a fully successfull classification.
