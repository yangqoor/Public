# Classification
`Classification` is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes.

The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y).

Example: The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. The model is trained on the basis of millions of emails on different parameters, and whenever it receives a new email, it identifies whether the email is spam or not. If the email is spam, then it is moved to the Spam folder.

In `Classification` it is how the data looks like has a diffrent type of classification.  
Types of possible Classification Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines
- Kernel SVM
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification
- Neural Networks
<!-- - [`Binary Classification`](./binary_classification/README.md) -->

## Subsets of `Classification`:
##### best way is to learn is from `TOP` to `BOTTOM`.
