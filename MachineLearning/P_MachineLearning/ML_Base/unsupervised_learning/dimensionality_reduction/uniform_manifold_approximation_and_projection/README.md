# UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
`UMAP` is an algorithm for dimension reduction based on manifold learning techniques and ideas from topological data analysis. It provides a very general framework for approaching manifold learning and dimension reduction, but can also provide specific concrete realizations. This article will discuss how the algorithm works in practice. There exist deeper mathematical underpinnings, but for the sake of readability by a general audience these will merely be referenced and linked.
