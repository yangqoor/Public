# Agglomerative Clustering
[`Agglomerative Clustering`](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/hierarchical-clustering/) is the most common type of hierarchical clustering used to group objects in clusters based on their similarity.  
Itâ€™s also known as AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting).  
The algorithm starts by treating each object as a singleton cluster.  
Next, pairs of clusters are successively merged until all clusters have been merged into one big cluster containing all objects.  
The result is a tree-based representation of the objects, named `Dendrogram`.
