# Unsupervised Learning (UL)  
`Unsupervised learning` (UL) is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that, through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world and then generate imaginative content. In contrast to `supervised learning` (SL) where data is tagged by a human, `e.g.` as "car" or "fish" etc, UL exhibits self-organization that captures patterns as neuronal predilections or probability densities. The other levels in the supervision spectrum are reinforcement learning where the machine is given only a numerical performance score as its guidance, and semi-supervised learning where a smaller portion of the data is tagged. Two broad methods in UL are Neural Networks and Probabilistic Methods.
