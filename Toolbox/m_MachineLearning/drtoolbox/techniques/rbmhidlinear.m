% This program trains Restricted Boltzmann Machine in which
% visible, binary, stochastic pixels are connected to
% hidden, tochastic real-valued feature detectors drawn from a unit
% variance Gaussian whose mean is determined by the input from 
% the logistic visible units. Learning is done with 1-step Contrastive Divergence.
% The program assumes that the following variables are set externally:
% maxepoch  -- maximum number of epochs
% numhid    -- number of hidden units
% batchdata -- the data that is divided into batches (numcases numdims numbatches)
% restart   -- set to 1 if learning starts from beginning
