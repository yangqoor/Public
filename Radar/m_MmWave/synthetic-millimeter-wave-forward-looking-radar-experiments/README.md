for vehicles, comparison between direct and synthetic scan
RT, 10 sensors are able to gain a much higher angle-resolution for forward-looking millimeter wave radar.
Sensors are put in order on the front panel of vehicle. 
In this experiment, 10 sensors, 0.18m space, 1.8m total length, on the front panel, forward-looking.
Scene contains buildings outside the road,  a telegraph pole (point), and a 2m wide car.
Direct Scan cannot distinguish them, but the Synthetic ok.
