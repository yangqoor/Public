# Content Intro
This repository contains the software simulation of Radar SAR imaging,including the Linear Frequency Modulation(LFM, basic signal employed in SAR imaging), the simple SAR imaging with Dots Targets(you may learn how SAR works), and finally the real data processing( An image is obtained after the processing of raw data.
