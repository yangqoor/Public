DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:

1. Utility FFT Codes: ftx.m fty.m fty.m ifty.m
   These four codes are forward and inverse FFT routines for a two-dimensional
   signal, e.g., f(x,y) and its Fourier transform F(k_x,k_y):
     x or k_x: first variable;
     y or k_y: second variable.
   The routines can be used for any two-dimensional signal, e.g., s(t,u).
   In this case, t is the first variable, and u is the second variable.
   For two-dimensional FFT, use ftx(fty(array).

2. Chapter 1 Code: range.m
   This code is for simulation and reconstruction in a one-dimensional range
   imaging system with a pulsed chirp signal.

3. Chapter 2 Code: crange.m
   This code is for simulation and reconstruction in a one-dimensional
   cross-range imaging system.

4. Chapter 3 Code: rad_pat.m
   This code provides the transmit/receive radiation patterns of a planar
   or parabolic radar, and their Fourier (Doppler) spectra.

5. Chapter 5 Code: spotlight.m
   This code simulates a spotlight SAR database. Four reconstruction
   algorithms (spatial frequency domain interpolation, range stacking, time
   domain correlation, and backprojection) are provided.

6. Chapter 6 Code: stripmap.m
   This code simulates a stripmap SAR database. Four reconstruction
   algorithms (spatial frequency domain interpolation, range stacking, time
   domain correlation, and backprojection) are provided.

   NOTE: The spotlight SAR and stripmap SAR codes were designed to have
         common features in their reconstruction section; this was done
         to create a common basis for the two SAR systems that was more
         comprehendable to the user. The user should customize and
         optimize these codes depending on his application; see the discussion
         on the MATLAB codes at the end of Chapters 5 and 6. For instance,
         one should incorporate the more restrictive support band of the
         target spectrum in the (k_x,k_y) domain that depends on the
         modality of the SAR system (i.e., spotlight or stripmap). Also,
         for the "wide-bandwidth" SAR systems, convert the "narrow-bandwidth"
         digital spotlighting (via polar format reconstruction) into its
         wide-bandwidth version. 

7. Chapter 8 Codes: sig_sub_a.m sig_sub_b.m
   The first code, sig_sub_a.m, performs block-based signal subspace processing
   for detecting change or target registration using a simulated database.
   The second code, sig_sub_b.m, performs overlapping block-based signal
   subspace processing for motion tracking using a simulated database.
