# chis
Base repository for Chemical Holographic Imaging System modeling and its applications, including: python-miescattering, python-cnn, and python-ann repository.

MieScattering.py contains all functions needed to simulate a complex Mie scattering image both in 1-D and 2-D, near field and far field.

TraditionalMie.py contains a python class that calculates the Mie scattering traditionally. It is slow but slightly more accurate.

planewave.py contains a python class that simulates a planewave in free space and renders it to a 2-D plane.

animation.py contains a function that converts a data cube into .mp4 files.
