# Multi-objective Pathfinding & Optimisation

### How to install the problem in PlatEmo?
Insert the contents to the respective problem folder in PlatEmo (use the path information).
We have used ```PlatEmo 3.1```.

### How to use the problem in PlatEmo?
If you inserted everything correctly, after starting PlatEmo, you should see ```universalMOPF``` in the list of problems. Change the settings as wanted. Keep in mind, that you don't need to assign a value to ```M``` or ```D``` as these values are computed according to the settings. However, ```M``` is usually ```5``` and will be changeable in a future version.

### A note on the reference fronts
Please keep it mind, that a newer version of the reference fronts might be available at [the benchmark's website](https://ci.ovgu.de/Publications/Scalable+Many_Objective+Pathfinding+Benchmark+Suite-p-910.html) as I am continuously computing more of them.
