This is an implementation of Bilateral and Guided Image filtering 
in Matlab for the submission of course Advanced Image Analysis in 
Masters of Computer Vision, Universite de Bourgogne, France.

Usage:
The main.m file calls the function bilateralGray(), bilateralColor() and guidedfilter().

The bilateralColor() uses color images. Remaining ones use grayscale images. The guidedfilter takes two images, the additional one being guided image. The output will be plots of images in three different windows. The progress bar shows up during the computation. The Matlab console displays the total time taken to complete each of the function calculation.
