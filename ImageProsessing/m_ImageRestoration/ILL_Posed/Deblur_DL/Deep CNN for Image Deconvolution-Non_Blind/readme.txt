Distribution code Version 1.1 -- 16/01/2015

The code is created based on the method described in the following paper 
[1] Li Xu, Jimmy SJ. Ren, Ce Liu, Jiaya Jia, "Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Image Deconvolution" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2014.

A Nvidia GPU with 2GB memory or more is required to run the code. Matlab 2014b or later is required, the code was tested in Matlab 2014b with Nvidia Geforce GTX 780Ti.

The code and the algorithm are for non-comercial use only.
