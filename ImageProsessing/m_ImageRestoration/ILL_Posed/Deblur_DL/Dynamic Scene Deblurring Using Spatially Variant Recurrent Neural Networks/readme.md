This package contains the code of the image deblurring algorithm described in the paper: 
Jiawei Zhang, Jinshan Pan, Jimmy Ren, Yibing Song, Linchao Bao, Rynson W.H. Lau, Ming-Hsuan Yang, "Dynamic Scene Deblurring Using Spatially Variant Recurrent Neural Networks", CVPR 2018.

How to use
----------------
1. Please install matcaffe by
(1) compile caffe: make all -j8.
(2) compile matcaffe: make matcaffe.
2. Put training data into: ./matlab/train/data. There are a few images in that folder already.
3. Run train.m in ./matlab/train for training
4. Run test.m in ./matlab/test for testing
5. Download caffe model for testing in google drive(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uZ9QcUR1R7k5nFeCj4D7IZopJYr5b37Q/view?usp=sharing) or baidu pan(https://pan.baidu.com/s/19buirGFT6PLpfhIYQIcLaA password: 1fw5)

Experimental results
----------------
You can download the experimental results (using 'blur' other than 'blur_gamma' for testing data of 2017 CVPR Nah) from the proposed network and other state-of-the-art methods in baidu pan.
