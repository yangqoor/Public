Overview
--------
The function CSF_DEMO demonstrates denoising and deconvolution with the learned models from the paper, which can all be found in the folder "models" (the respective sub-folders indicate the relation to the paper). The paper and supplemental material are provided in the folder "paper".
Learning is implemented in CSF_TRAIN, which relies on functions from the folder "+train", and uses example data from folder "data".
Shrinkage functions are represented by RBFMIX objects, see folder "@rbfmix" for details.
The folder "+misc" contains miscellaneous helper functions.

An overview of the functions in a particular folder can be displayed by typing "help <folder/package>" at the MATLAB prompt (e.g. "help train").


Dependencies
------------
This code depends on MATLAB with the image processing toolbox and has been tested with R2010a and newer versions.
It further requires a gradient-based optimization algorithm for learning with CSF_TRAIN (see file "+train/get_minimizer.m").
The function CSF_PREDICT will make use of a supported GPU, if available.
For improved runtime performance, it is recommended to compile the MEX-plugin "@rbfmix/private/lut_eval.c"; compiled binaries are already provided for 64-bit Linux and Windows systems (with MATLAB R2012a).
