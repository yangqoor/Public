# Graph-Based-Blind-Image-Deblurring

This code is the upgraded implementation of our TIP paper "Graph-based Blind Image Deblurring from a Single Photograph".

## Prerequisite

Matlab(>=R2015a)

## Running the tests

```
Step 1. run graph_blind_main.m
Step 2. select a blurred image
```

## Parameters

Users only need to tune *ONE* parameter. On line 21, the estimated kernel size ***k_estimate_size***. 
* The ***k_estimate_size*** must be *LARGER* than the real kernel size (The default value is 69).
* In order to have the best performance, please set the value close to real kernel size and slightly larger.

If you want to turn off the intermediate output, you can set *show_intermediate=false* on line 22.

## About noise

In order to be more robust with noise, we add several denoising modules beyond the paper.
* We embed a TV denoising to pre-process the input image. 
* We add a wavelet domain filtering for intermediate output kernels. 
* We add a mask to filter small/noisy gradient in the gradient domain.

More sophisticated denoising, such as BM3D, can be done by users in advance.

## About Non-blind image deblurring

After kernel estimation with the proposed algorithm, we use the state-of-the-art methods to do non-blind image deblurring.
Here, we provide users with [1] to do the following non-blind image deblurring process.
Users can also employ [2] or the non-blind deblurring method in [3], by themselves.
