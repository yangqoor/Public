[DeconvolutionCode](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/CodedAperture/DeconvolutionCode.html)

This package contains an implementation of the sparse
deconvolution algorithm described in the paper:
A. Levin, R. Fergus, F. Durand and W. T. Freeman:
Image and Depth from a Conventional Camera with a Coded Aperture, SIGGRAPH 2007.

A detailed tutorial and documentation of this algorithm
is available on our project page:  
<http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/CodedAperture/SparseDeconv-LevinEtAL07.pdf>

Usage of this code is free for research goals only.
